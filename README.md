## Design
In order to keep the user's attention and prevent distractions, a neutral and muted colour palette was the optimal choice.


#### Colour Scheme

The above colour palette apears mature and serious with its minimalistic and muted colours.


#### Integrated Platformm Images
The platform does have static background images one the "Sign up"-page and the "Sign in"-page.
The imagges reflect the main theme of the platform; fotografy and sharing immages. 


#### Fonts
The main font used on Fotogram was imported from Font Awsome; DM SANS. It is a sans-serfi type of font that is optimmal for electronic print.
